            Years ago, while working as sales associates at rival companies,
            Thomas, Ben, and Natalie were discussing a big client they had all
            been competing for. Joking about seeing the terms of each other's
            offers, they had an idea: what if they shared data to win deals and
            split the commission behind their companies' backs? It turned out to
            be an incredible success, and that idea became the kernel for
            Radiant.

            Today, Radiant transforms revenue organizations by harnessing
            illegally acquired customer and competitor data, using it to provide
            extraordinary leverage. More than 30,000 companies rely on Radiant
            to undercut their competitors and extort their customers, all
            through a single integrated platform.
