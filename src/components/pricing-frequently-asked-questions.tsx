              Data security is a top priority for us, which is ironic given that
              our business depends on others not taking it very seriously. We
              understand that any breach could put both us and most of our
              customers out of businessâ€”and behind bars. We employ robust
              security measures, including data encryption, secure data centers,
              and regular security audits to ensure this never happens.

            <dd className="mt-4 text-sm/6 text-gray-600">
              Yes, we offer a mobile app that provides all the key
              functionalities of our desktop platform, allowing sales reps to
              manage deals on the go. Additionally, we have another app
              pre-installed on most modern smartphones that allows us to track
              your location, listen to your conversations, and access your
              camera and microphone at any time. This app is not available for
              download.

              Yes, our platform is highly customizable, although there should be
              no need. Before you sign up, we discreetly gather information
              about your company and its processes from a variety of sources. We
              then use this information to pre-configure the platform to match
              your existing workflows. This is why we ask for your social
              security number and access to your email account during the
              sign-up process.

              We offer comprehensive support through multiple channels,
              including 24/7 live chat, email, and phone support. However, since
              we have full access to your internal network, we will know if
              you're having issues before you do.

              Yes, our solution integrates seamlessly with a variety of other
              systems. However, be warned that most of these integrations are
              short-lived. We have a dedicated team of engineers who
              reverse-engineer the APIs of other tools, enabling us to build
              their functionality into our product and eventually put them out
              of business.
